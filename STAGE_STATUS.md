## Current Stage

**STAGE 11 — Simulation to Display Connection**

## Current Status

**COMPLETE** — Live GridSimulation wired into renderer; panels and canvas reflect real state; flow markers animate; 9/9 tests pass.

## Session Log

### Session 12 (Stage 11 — Simulation to Display Connection)
- Written: `src/display/animation.py` — FlowAnimator: directional flow markers on all active lines (speed ∝ loading, direction from flow sign, colour by voltage level)
- Edited: `src/display/panels.py` — all four functions accept live state; static fallbacks preserved for state=None
- Edited: `src/display/renderer.py` — set_grid(), on_scroll(); tick() accepts speed_mult; FlowAnimator driven after canvas draw
- Edited: `src/main.py` — GridSimulation instantiated per session; speed keys 0-4; shift-switch F1/F3/F5; mouse wheel scroll
- Fixed: `src/display/canvas.py` — state.blackout_buses → state.blackout_zones
- Validated: simulation runs live; all panels update each frame; 9/9 tests pass

### Session 11 (Stage 10 — Instrument Strip Panels)
- Written: `src/display/panels.py` — four draw functions: frequency (large Hz readout, analog bar, trend), power balance (6-row MW summary), unit dispatch (scrollable list with state colours, output bars), alarm feed (scrollable list, 2Hz blink on unacked)
- Edited: `src/display/renderer.py` — replace plain strip fill with four panel subsurfaces; add 2Hz blink timer and dispatch/alarm scroll offsets
- Edited: `src/simulation/constants.py` — add FONT_SIZE_PANEL, FONT_SIZE_PANEL_LARGE, PANEL_FREQ_X/W, PANEL_POWER_X/W, PANEL_DISPATCH_X/W, PANEL_ALARM_X/W
- Stage 10 uses static test constants (marked # TEST DATA); Stage 11 swaps to live SimulationState fields
- Validated: window opens, strip draws all four panels; 9/9 tests still pass

### Session 10 (Stage 9 — Static Grid Renderer)
- Written: `src/display/symbols.py` — all procedural drawing functions (substation, unit squares, collector lines, transmission lines, hydraulic connectors, interconnector markers)
- Written: `src/display/canvas.py` — GridCanvas: draws all buses, lines, and unit squares by shift onto the 1920×844 canvas surface
- Written: `src/display/renderer.py` — Renderer: native 1920×1080 surface, layer compositing, blink phase, debug overlay, scales to display
- Written: `src/main.py` — pygame init, window, main loop; keys 1/3/5 switch shift, D toggles debug overlay
- Fixed: `src/utils/helpers.py` — `resource_path()` base was `src/utils/` instead of `src/`; corrected to `Path(__file__).parent.parent`
- Added: font fallback in Renderer — uses `pygame.freetype.SysFont('monospace', 11)` when JetBrainsMono is not yet installed
- Validated: window opens clean; 9/9 tests still pass
- Note: Stage 7 (events.py scripted event system) remains deferred until after rendering is complete

### Session 9 (Stage 8 — Master Simulation Loop)
- Written: `src/simulation/simulation.py` — Alarm, SimulationState, ForecastResult dataclasses + GridSimulation
- Fixed: `FleetModel.get_state_snapshot()` returns per-unit dicts; `_build_state()` now transposes to per-field dicts
- Fixed: `DCLoadFlow.rebuild()` and `VoltageModel.rebuild()` updated to accept optional `lines_in_service` list; `_build_b_matrix/_build_b_prime` now read from `_active_lines` instead of calling `grid.get_active_lines()` directly
- Added: `test_simulation_model()` — 6 sub-checks, all PASS
- Validation: 9/9 tests passed
- Note: Stage 7 (events.py scripted event system) deferred until after rendering is complete

### Session 8 (Stage 6 — Cascade Detection and Island Finding)
- Written: `src/simulation/cascade.py` — CascadeModel (BFS island finding, overload timers, blackout zones)
- Added: `test_cascade_model()` — 4 sub-checks, all PASS
- Validation: 8/8 tests passed
- Note: discovered topology has intentionally isolated buses (cascade stations, BARD, KELD, WNCN are radial generation buses with no looped transmission connections; load substations have no 60kV lines modelled)

### Session 1 (Setup)

- Configured `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`, `.claudeignore`
- Created `requirements.txt` (pygame-ce, numpy)

### Session 7 (Stage 5 — Demand, Renewables, and Losses)
- Written: `src/simulation/demand.py` — DemandModel (profile + noise + load shed + losses)
- Written: `src/simulation/renewables.py` — RenewablesModel (wind/solar with noise, deterministic mode)
- Added: `test_demand_model()` — 5 sub-checks, all PASS
- Added: `test_renewables_model()` — 4 sub-checks, all PASS
- Validation: 7/7 tests passed

### Session 6 (Stage 4 — Generation Unit State Machine)
- Written: `src/simulation/units.py` — UnitModel + FleetModel
- Added: `test_unit_model()` — 9 sub-checks, all PASS
- Validation: 5/5 tests passed

### Session 5 (Stage 3 — Frequency and Voltage Models)
- Written: `src/simulation/frequency.py` — FrequencyModel (swing equation + droop)
- Written: `src/simulation/voltage.py` — VoltageModel (decoupled ΔV = B'⁻¹ × Q)
- Added: `VSHUNT_REG = 0.1` to `constants.py` for voltage B' matrix stability (isolated load buses)
- Added: `test_frequency_model()` — 4 sub-checks, all PASS
- Added: `test_voltage_model()` — 3 sub-checks, all PASS
- Validation: 4/4 tests passed

### Session 4 (Stage 2 — DC Load Flow Solver)
- Written: `src/simulation/loadflow.py` — DCLoadFlow class + LoadFlowResult
- Fixed: L10, L11, L29 active_from_shift mismatches (bus/line activation consistency)
- Added: `test_loadflow_solves()` — 5 sub-checks, all PASS
- Validation: 2/2 tests passed

### Session 3 (Stage 1 — Network Data Model)
- Written: `src/utils/helpers.py` — resource_path() for dev + PyInstaller builds
- Written: `src/simulation/constants.py` — all numeric constants, thresholds, timings
- Written: `src/display/palette.py` — all RGB colour constants
- Written: `src/data/topology.py` — Bus + Line dataclasses, 40 buses, 29 lines
- Written: `src/data/fleet.py` — GenerationUnit dataclass, 47 units across all stations
- Written: `src/data/profiles.py` — demand/wind/solar profiles, ShiftSpec for all 10 shifts
- Written: `src/simulation/grid.py` — Grid class with full public interface
- Written: `tests/test_simulation.py` — test_grid_loads() with 8 sub-checks
- Fixed: corrupted UTF-16 __init__.py placeholders → empty UTF-8
- Validation: 1/1 tests passed

## What Is In Progress

Nothing. Stage 11 complete.

---

## What Is NOT Yet Built

**Gameplay stages have empty placeholder files only.**
**Stage 7 (events.py) is deliberately deferred until after rendering is complete.**

Do not reference any display or gameplay module as if it
contains working code unless listed above as complete.

Specifically — these classes and functions DO NOT EXIST YET:
- `EventSystem` / `ScriptedEvent` (src/simulation/events.py) — deferred
- Context panel (src/display/context.py)
- Any gameplay classes (src/gameplay/*)

---

## Next Session Objective

**Stage 12 — Player Interaction**

Goal: All player controls for Shift 1 via both mouse and keyboard.

Files to write/extend:
1. `src/display/context.py` — context panels near selected element (bus, unit, line, load)
2. `src/display/canvas.py`  — hit detection: click → select bus/unit/line
3. `src/main.py`            — Tab/Enter/Escape/Arrow navigation; A = ACK alarm
4. Unit controls: SET OUTPUT target (numeric input)
3. `src/display/panels.py`   — Replace # TEST DATA constants with live state field reads
4. `src/display/animation.py`— Flow markers on lines (speed ∝ loading, direction from flow sign)

---

## Open Decisions

None at this stage. All architectural decisions are locked in the reference documents.

---

## Known Issues

None.

## How To Update This File

At the end of every Claude Code session:

1. Move completed items from "In Progress" to "Built and Validated"
2. Update "What Is NOT Yet Built" — remove things that now exist
3. Set the new "Next Session Objective"
4. Add a row to Validation History
5. Note any Open Decisions or Known Issues
6. Commit: `git commit -m "Stage X: [description] — update STAGE_STATUS.md"`

This file is the memory between sessions. Keep it accurate.
